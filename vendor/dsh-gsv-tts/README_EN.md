## ✨ Features

- 🌐 **Cloud Quick Mode (Edge)**: **zero configuration, ready to use** — no Python / models / engines needed; 20+ free natural voices (Xiaoxiao, Yunxi, Aria, etc.), online and < 1 s to first audio
- 🖥️ **Local Pro Mode (GSV)**: **clone a target voice from a reference audio**, **fully offline**; guided one-step upgrade from Cloud Quick Mode
- 🔊 **One-click read-aloud**: a 🔊 button next to every assistant message (reasoning content excluded); long replies are **split into sentence segments and played progressively**, with Pause/Resume/Stop controls, a progress readout, and a highlight on the message being read
- 🔁 **Auto-read**: automatically reads assistant replies; new replies interrupt the current read by default (barge-in), toggleable in settings
- 🔄 **Mode switching**: one click in the settings panel between "Quick / Local Pro"; voices and status follow live
- 🎛️ **Voice Settings panel**: configure everything visually, **hot-applied** (no restart); preview any voice individually or loop-preview all for comparison
- 🎪 **Voice Market**: **one-click download and injection** of voices from the bundled or a custom remote manifest, with preview-before-install and read-only management; bundled trusted sources install without confirmation, remote sources require a second confirmation
- 🚀 **One-click engine start/stop & setup**: local GSV engine control (model loading ~15–90 s) and auto-install, all from the settings panel / tools
- 🔗 **Same-origin audio short links**: synthesized audio is saved and served same-origin — no more giant data URLs in the model context

## 🎯 Quick Start (either mode)

| What you want | Which mode | How to begin |
|---|---|---|
| "I just want it to **read as soon as it's installed**" | 🌐 **Quick Mode (Edge)** | See "Quick Mode (Edge)" below — **no installation needed** |
| "I want to **clone my own voice / be fully offline**" | 🖥️ **Local Pro Mode (GSV)** | See "Local Pro Mode (GSV)" below |

> **Default mode**: fresh installs default to **Edge Quick Mode** (works online); **existing users upgrading keep GSV local mode with voices unchanged**, and can switch anytime in the settings panel.

### 1. Quick Mode (Edge, default for new installs)

1. Install the plugin and restart DSH (see "📦 Installation")
2. Open Settings → Voice Settings → **TTS Mode** → select **Quick (Edge)**
3. Pick a cloud voice from the "Voice" dropdown (Xiaoxiao / Yunxi / Aria…)
4. Click the 🔊 next to any assistant message — **audio plays immediately, < 1 s**

> No Python, no models, no engine to start. Only a network connection is required. Cloud voices are marked 🌐, giving you a zero-config path to listening right away.

### 2. Local Pro Mode (GSV)

1. Install the plugin and restart DSH (see "📦 Installation")
2. Open Settings → Voice Settings → **TTS Mode** → select **Local Pro (GSV)**
3. **Install the engine**: have the agent call `tts_setup_engine`, or see "🔧 Installing the GSV-TTS-Lite Engine"
4. **Start the engine**: toggle "Start engine" on and wait until it shows "Running"
5. **Add a voice**: add one under "Voice presets", or one-click download from the "🎪 Voice Market", or clone one
6. Click the 🔊 next to any assistant message, or have the agent call `tts_speak`

> Local Pro mode runs fully offline and supports voice cloning — independent of network and cloud quotas.

## 📦 Installation

Choose one of the two methods, then enable it in Settings:

```bash
# Option 1: Install from npm
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-gsv-tts

# Option 2: Install from GitHub
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:TaoruiLiu19/dsh-gsv"
```

> **About profiles**: the commands above use the `web` profile as an example. Desktop users typically use the `desktop` profile — just replace `web` with `desktop`.

After installing, restart DSH. The tools register automatically and a "Voice Settings" item appears in Settings.

> Requires the DSH `webServer` service (bundled with the Web/Desktop profiles) for audio delivery and the `settings` service for the settings panel. Environments without these services keep only the tool capabilities.

## 🔄 Mode Switching & Migration

| Item | Description |
|---|---|
| How to switch | Settings → Voice Settings → **TTS Mode** (Quick / Local Pro), applied instantly |
| Config field | `provider: 'edge' \| 'gsv'` (assigned at init; switch from the settings panel rather than editing manually) |
| Existing users upgrading | Old config with no `provider` field → stays `gsv` local mode, **voices unchanged** |
| Fresh installs | Default to `edge` cloud Quick mode, ready online |
| `schemaVersion` | Config schema version — the migration guard marker |

> Edge mode needs network; if the cloud is unavailable, the panel shows "cloud channel busy / temporarily unavailable", and local GSV mode is always available as a fallback.

## 🏗️ Architecture

![dsh-gsv-tts system composition & data flow](docs/images/architecture.png)

> 📖 Interactive diagram: [open dsh-gsv-tts.architecture.html](docs/architecture/dsh-gsv-tts.architecture.html) (zoom, focus, theme switching)

**Dual-provider architecture**: `TTSService` dispatches to the cloud (Edge) or local (GSV) provider by `config.provider`; the read-aloud main path and the tool-call path are identical for both providers.

- 🔊 **Read-aloud path (via webServer)**: user clicks 🔊 → DSH Web client → the `webServer` `/speak` route → `TTSService` requests via the active provider → cloud/local engine returns audio chunks → `AudioStore` saves them → a same-origin short link is returned to the browser for playback.
- 🤖 **Agent tool calls (in-process, direct)**: when the agent calls `tts_speak` and friends, the host's in-process tools service executes the plugin logic **directly — no webServer HTTP gateway involved**.

| Part | Description |
|------|-------------|
| DSH app (DeepSeek Harness) | Plugin host: Web client, webServer, settings service |
| dsh-gsv-tts plugin | `TTSService` (provider dispatch) / `AudioStore` (storage) / engine manager (start-stop · setup · health check) |
| Edge provider | `edge-tts-universal`, curated Microsoft web voices, returns an MP3 stream (decoded by the browser) |
| GSV-TTS-Lite local engine | Local Python process, FastAPI :9880, true streaming `/tts/stream`, returns WAV |

## 🌐 Quick Mode (Edge) in detail

- **Voices**: 20+ curated Microsoft natural voices (Chinese Xiaoxiao / Yunxi / Yunye, etc.; English Aria and friends), pick from the panel dropdown — no configuration.
- **Output**: MP3 audio stream generated by `edge-tts-universal`, saved by `AudioStore` as `.mp3` and served same-origin; the browser decodes it directly (**zero transcoding overhead**).
- **Health check**: built-in connection timeout, automatic token refresh and error recovery; the panel shows cloud availability.
- **Rate limit & fallback**: Microsoft may rate-limit heavy usage. If the cloud is detected unavailable, the panel guides you to switch to local GSV (unlimited + cloneable).
- **Quota field**: `quotaDaily` (default `null` = unlimited) is a reserved guidance field; hard quotas come in a later release.

## 🖥️ Local Pro Mode (GSV) in detail

- **Capability**: **clone a target voice** from a reference audio; fully offline — data never leaves the machine.
- **Cost**: requires a Python environment + model download; first model load takes ~15–90 s.
- **Entry points**: see "🔧 Installing the GSV-TTS-Lite Engine" and "🎙️ Adding a Voice / Voice Market".

## 🔧 Installing the GSV-TTS-Lite Engine

### Option 1: Automatic (recommended)

Ask the agent to call `tts_setup_engine`. It automatically: detects Python → installs `gsv-tts-lite==0.4.7` → clones the repo → installs dependencies → deploys the streaming API → starts the service.

### Option 2: Manual

1. Install **Python 3.10+** (3.12 recommended) with `pip` available
2. Install the core package: `pip install gsv-tts-lite==0.4.7`
3. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/chinokikiss/GSV-TTS-Lite.git`
4. Install API dependencies: `pip install -r <repo>/API/requirements.txt`
5. Copy `dsh_stream_api.py` from this plugin's `scripts/` folder into `<repo>/API/` (true streaming API)
6. Download the models (`s1v3.ckpt`, `s2Gv2ProPlus.pth`, ...) into `<repo>/models/`
7. Start: `python <repo>/API/dsh_stream_api.py -p 9880 --models_dir <repo>/models`
8. In Settings → Voice Settings, toggle the engine on to verify

> Example audio lives in `<repo>/examples/` (`laffey.mp3`, `AnAn.ogg`) — usable as test voices.

## 🎪 Voice Market

Download and inject voices from the Voice Market in one click — no need to fill in reference audio paths manually.

1. Open Settings → Voice Settings → **Voice Market**
2. Browse the voice cards (source, author, license); click **Preview** to listen
3. Click **Install**:
   - Bundled trusted manifest (`trusted`) → installs directly
   - Custom remote manifest (`voiceRegistryUrl`) → second confirmation of source & license before installing
4. Installed voices are added to "Voice presets" and can be used from 🔊 / `tts_speak`
5. Market-installed voices are **read-only** in the panel (uninstall only) to keep the id ledger intact; **Uninstall** can (with a prompt) also delete the local audio files

> **Trust rule**: trust ships with the plugin build. Only the bundled offline manifest marked as trusted installs without confirmation; **any remote manifest always requires a second confirmation** (even if it claims to be trusted). For custom voices, add them manually under "Voice presets".

## 🎙️ Adding a Voice (local GSV)

1. Open Settings → Voice Settings
2. Under "Voice presets", click "Add voice"
3. Fill in the four fields:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `Voice name` | Voice identifier used by `tts_speak` and the 🔊 button | `Laffey` |
| `Speaker audio path` | Reference audio of the target voice (defines who it sounds like) | `D:\GSV\GSV-TTS-Lite\examples\laffey.mp3` |
| `Prompt audio path` | Intonation/emotion reference audio | `D:\GSV\GSV-TTS-Lite\examples\AnAn.ogg` |
| `Prompt text` | The text of the prompt audio (required — the engine has no ASR fallback) | `ちが……ちがう。レイア、貴様は間違っている。` |

4. Click "Save" — changes apply instantly, no restart
5. Leave the default voice empty to use the first voice in the list

> Reference audio paths must be **local paths accessible from the engine host or reachable URLs**.

## ⚙️ Voice Settings Reference

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| TTS Mode | Quick (Edge cloud, zero setup) / Local Pro (GSV, offline & cloning) | existing users `gsv` / fresh installs `edge` |
| Engine switch | Start/stop the GSV-TTS-Lite engine process | Off |
| `apiUrl` | Engine API URL | `http://localhost:9880` |
| `defaultVoice` | Default voice (gsv=preset name / edge=cloud voice id; empty = first) | empty |
| `timeout` | Request timeout (ms) | `30000` |
| `installDir` | Engine install directory | `./GSV-TTS-Lite` |
| `autoPlay` | Auto-read assistant replies | `false` |
| `interruptOnNew` | Whether new replies interrupt the current read in auto-read mode (off = skip new replies while reading to avoid overlap) | `true` |
| `voiceRegistryUrl` | Remote voice-market manifest URL (empty = bundled offline manifest) | empty |
| `provider` | `gsv` \| `edge` (assigned at init; switch in the settings panel) | see "TTS Mode" |
| `schemaVersion` | Config schema version (migration guard marker) | `1` |
| `quotaDaily` | Daily quota for cloud simple mode (`null` = unlimited; guidance only) | `null` |
| `voices` | Voice preset list | empty |

Config is stored in DSH settings (the `dsh-gsv-tts:` section of `~/.dsh/settings.yaml`) and hot-applied on change.

## 🧰 Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tts_speak` | Text-to-speech; uses the active provider & voice, streams, returns a same-origin short link |
| `tts_list_voices` | List voices available for the active provider |
| `tts_health_check` | Check the active provider (engine/cloud) status |
| `tts_setup_engine` | One-click GSV-TTS-Lite engine installation |

## ❓ FAQ

- **How do I hear audio right away?**: Edge mode is the default — no installation at all; just pick a voice in the settings panel. Only Local Pro needs the engine installed.
- **Engine not running (Local Pro)**: Settings → Voice Settings → toggle on (model loading takes ~15–90 s)
- **Models missing**: the first start will warn; put the models into the `models` directory
- **The read button says "TTS engine not started"**: if you're on local GSV, start the engine in Voice Settings first; if you don't want an engine, switch back to Edge Quick mode
- **Some cloud voices won't read?**: make sure the network is up; when the cloud channel is limited, switch to local GSV
- **Reference audio unavailable**: use a local path accessible from the engine host or a reachable URL

## 📜 Changelog

Full release history: [CHANGELOG_EN.md](CHANGELOG_EN.md).

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Playback is a clickable markdown link; inline `<audio>` playback needs a client extension (planned)
- Generated audio lives in the system temp dir (`%TEMP%/dsh-gsv-tts`), purged on startup, capped at 200 files per session
- Edge cloud mode depends on network; when Microsoft rate-limits, it may be unavailable (already has a downgrade guide)
- `tts_setup_engine` shells out to pip/git; those tools must be available
- Empty `promptText` relies on the engine's ASR capability (capability-probed); synthesis fails with a clear error when unsupported
